Smart Attendance system is an AI powered face recognition solution which uses Computer Vision and Machine Learning algorithms to mark the attendance of the employees or students of the organisation.
The system will work on face recognition where each student in the class will be photographed and their details will be stored in a server. The student then has to look at the camera for at least 3 seconds and then his attendance will be recorded. This system will also recorded how many people entered and how many people left a particular room, thus telling total number of people in the room. 

Benefits: It offers the time attendance tracking that allows excluding the time lapses among the students. No more late coming, everyone now has to pass a face scanning device to check-in for institutions.
